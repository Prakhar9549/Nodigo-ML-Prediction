# Nodigo - No code ML Prediction

We are making a platform where no-code ML models can be trained. We are providing different algorithms through which the user can select and train model of their choice and see the output in seconds. Also, we are adding authentication so that the user can log in anytime in his/her account and see their already trained models. 

# Use Case

1. We are providing different algorithms of ML at one stop only.
2. The user can use the platform easily even if he/she is not familiar with the tech.
3. The platform is FREE to use in the market and is open-source also.
4. Report of the previously trained models can be accessed in the user account.
